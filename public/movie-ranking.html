        <h3>Upgrade</h3>
        <p>
            The relevance of this movie only increases by the day. In spite of some truly gruesome violence, <br \>
            Upgrade proves to be far greater than the sum of its parts. Set in a very near future, it depicts a world in which <br \>
            players in the world of AI and cybernetic modification dominate society and virtually run rough-shod all over any <br \>
            semblance of human legal or moral authority with the aim of establishing complete dominance over all realms of human <br \> 
            knowledge and ability. Its ending is the most thought-provoking commentary on consciousness I have been witness to in <br \>
            any art medium.
        </p>
        <h3>Tombstone</h3>
        <p>
            While far from a perfect movie, the biggest thing Tombstone has going for it is a truly<br \>
            show-stealing performance from the recently deceased Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. I consider<br \>
            it a treatise on what true friendship means.
        </p>
        <h3>Sinners</h3>
        <p>
            Director Ryan Coogler has achieved something singular with his most recent oeuvre, Sinners.<br \>
            The movie engages every sensory mode available to it on the way to communicating the Black American<br \>
            experience in a more complete way than has ever been done before. It is so densely impregnated with<br \>
            gems and Easter eggs of cultural reference in its entirety, in every frame, that it has inspired<br \>
            a popular tidal wave not just digital content creator analysis of its abundant instances of symbolism.<br />
            Sinners does all this and more while simultanadvancing the state of the art cinematographically.
