            <h3>Upgrade</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/upgrade_thumbnail.jpg">
            <p>
                The relevance of this movie only increases by the day. In spite of some truly gruesome violence, Upgrade 
                proves to be far greater than the sum of its parts. Set in a very near future, it depicts a world in 
                which players in the AI and cyborg spheres of influence dominate society and virtually run rough-shod all over
                any semblance of human legal or moral authority with the aim of establishing complete dominance over all realms 
                of human knowledge and ability. Its ending is, frankly, the most thought-provoking commentary on consciousness I 
                have been witness to in any art medium.

         <h3>Tombstone</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/tombstone_thumbnail.jpg">
            <p>
                While far from a perfect movie, the biggest thing Tombstone has going for it is a truly
                show-stealing performance from the recently deceased Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. While it is, 
                indeed, a fairly typical '90s Western, I think many people call it a classic. I begrudgingly agree, 
                clearly not because I don't love the film, but rather labeling it 'classic' makes me feel old. Regardless,
                I consider it a treatise on the true meaning of friendship.

                <h3>Sinners</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/sinners_thumbnail.jpg">
            <p>
                Director Ryan Coogler has achieved something singular with his most recent oeuvre, Sinners.
                The movie engages every sensory mode available to it on the way to communicating the Black American
                experience in a more complete way than has ever been done before. It is so densely impregnated with
                gems and Easter eggs of cultural reference in its entirety, in every frame, that it has inspired
                a popular tidal wave of digital content creator analysis of its abundant instances of symbolism.
                Sinners does all this and more while simultaneously advancing the state of the art cinematographically.

                <h3>Honorable mention: The Dark Knight</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/dark_knight_joker_thumbnail.jpg">
            <p>Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors. His cinematographic sense and the epic scale he brings to his 
            projects are but a few of the many reasons I love his catalog. His foray into the comic book superhero genre with the 
            Dark Knight trilogy may have been the best ever by a single director, though the bar might be set a bit low when 
            the whole genre is considered. The titular second iteration of the series, The Dark Knight, has another one of my favorite 
            performances by an actor, that of Heath Ledger as the Joker. It rightfully earned him a posthumous Oscar. Ledger  
            unarguably steals the show from the very beginning of the movie. Honestly, I could easily interchange this pick 
            with the above mentioned Tombstone.
