        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I want to bring the totality of my experience, training, and education as a linguist, software engineer, data scientist, and 
            mathematician to bear on meaningful and complex problems.</p> 
            <br\> 
            <p>Ethics and integrity are of the utmost importance to me -- if your business places profitability over morality, 
            I'm not interested.</p> 
            <br\>
            <p>The sense of pride I need to have in my work is not solely contingent upon technical outcomes.</p>
            <br\>
            <p>The overarching goals of any prospective endeavor I consider must be directed at contributing to a better world for ALL of 
                us.</p>
