            <h3>Upgrade</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/upgrade_thumbnail.jpg">
            <p>
                The relevance of this movie only increases by the day. In spite of some truly gruesome violence, Upgrade <br \>
                proves to be far greater than the sum of its parts. Set in a very near future, it depicts a world in <br \>
                which players in the AI and cyborg spheres of influence dominate society and virtually run rough-shod all over <br \> 
                any semblance of human legal or moral authority with the aim of establishing complete dominance over all realms <br \>
                of human knowledge and ability. Its ending is, frankly, the most thought-provoking commentary on consciousness I <br \>
                have been witness to in any art medium.

         <h3>Tombstone</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/tombstone_thumbnail.jpg">
            <p>
                While far from a perfect movie, the biggest thing Tombstone has going for it is a truly<br \>
                show-stealing performance from the recently deceased Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday. I consider<br \>
                it a treatise on the true meaning of friendship.

                <h3>Sinners</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/sinners_thumbnail.jpg">
            <p>
                Director Ryan Coogler has achieved something singular with his most recent oeuvre, Sinners.<br \>
                The movie engages every sensory mode available to it on the way to communicating the Black American<br \>
                experience in a more complete way than has ever been done before. It is so densely impregnated with<br \>
                gems and Easter eggs of cultural reference in its entirety, in every frame, that it has inspired<br \>
                a popular tidal wave of digital content creator analysis of its abundant instances of symbolism.<br />
                Sinners does all this and more while simultaneously advancing the state of the art cinematographically.

                <h3>Honorable mention: The Dark Knight</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/dark_knight_joker_thumbnail.jpg">
            <p>Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite directors. His cinematographic sense and the epic scale he seems to <br \>
            bring are a few of the many reasons I love his catalog. His foray into the comic book superhero genre with the <br \>
            Dark Knight trilogy may have been the best ever by a single director, though perhaps it's a low bar when the whole <br \>
            genre is considered. The titular second iteration of the series, The Dark Knight, has another one of my favorite <br \>
            performances by an actor, that of Heath Ledger as the Joker. It rightfully earned him a posthumous Oscar. Ledger <br \> 
            unarguably steals the show from the very beginning of the movie. Honestly, I could easily interchange this pick <br \>
            with the above mentioned Tombstone.
