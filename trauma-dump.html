    <h1>Trauma Dump</h1>
  <p>
    Fuck that Lorem Ipsum shit. What conclusions can you draw from the way I'm starting this paragraph? I'm 
    tired of the bullshit. My life is crumbling around me. I'm failing at everything.
  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I'm way out of my depth trying to work on this math degree. I just took a course on quantum logic and got completely torched.
        My professor had mercy on me and gave me a D, but I really failed. 
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm dead to my daughter. According to her, our relationship cannot be salvaged. She says I've failed her as a father. I can't 
        say she's wrong.
      </li> 
      <li>
        My son could care less about any and every thing. He's fallen in with a bad crowd and he's 
        smoking.
      </li> 
      <li>
        My wife might divorce me if I can't fix my relationship with my kids. She's tired of my bullshit. She's the best human being 
        I know who is still alive. AND she's fucking hot.
      </li> 
      <li>
        Finally, to top it all off, I'm on a PIP at work. If the gen AI-powered layoff axe comes down, my neck will be one of the many
        on the chopping block.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    I'm about to start some talk therapy (again) for my under-treated and very long-term dysthymia (aka persistent depressive disorder) 
    which now might be full-blown depression, if the internets are correct. I have some demons I need to fight. I have been putting this 
    fight off for too long. This is starting to sound like the beginning of some drama series pitch to Netflix or something. But it's 
    not; it's my life right now. It's a complete fucking mess.

    I feel like I've lost my purpose. I care about my wife and kids, but apparently not enough to show them that I care. Aside from that, 
    I'm damn near nihilistic. I've been doom-scrolling on IG, watching a bunch of porn (although, to my worthless credit, most of my 
    searches are for my wife's body type, if that means anything), playing video games. Hopefully, therapy is a step in the right direction, but who knows?

  <p>I'm probably going to hide this in invisible font or not link it at all. So, if you do see it, I hope it doesn't depress you. At
    least not more than I already am. </p>
